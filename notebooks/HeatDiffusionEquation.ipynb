For the 2D heat diffusion equation, this is a five-point stencil, which includes a central point, the reference centroid, a point north, east, south, and west thereof. The index of these points, which also defines the position of the coefficients in the coefficient matrix for each equation in the system of equations, can be defined using the local indices $i$ and $j$.

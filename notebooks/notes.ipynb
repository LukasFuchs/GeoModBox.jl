    "A fundamental and intuitive approach to solving the 1D heat diffusion equation is the **Forward in Time and Centered in Space (FTCS)** scheme, implemented in an **explicit** manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method approximates the continuous PDE on a discrete grid and converges to the analytical solution as the spatial ($\\Delta x$) and temporal ($\\Delta t$) resolutions are refined. Its main advantages are **simplicity** and **computational efficiency**.\n",

    "We can solve for the unknown vector $\\bm{x}$ by assuming an initial temperature guess, calculating its residual, and performing a correction of the temperature.

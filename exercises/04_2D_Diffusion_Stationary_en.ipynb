    "Assume that Equation (2) is defined in a 2D rectangular domain with a side length ($L$) of 4000 m and a depth ($H$) of 2000 m. Within the domain, a body with a high heat production rate is embedded, with corner coordinates (x, z) in km: (1900, 900), (2100, 900), (2100, 1100), and (1900, 1100). The heat production rate $Q$ is 0.3 W/m<sup>3</sup> inside the body and 0 outside. The thermal conductivity ($k$) is 6.5 W/(K m). As a boundary condition (Dirichlet), set T = 0 °C along the entire boundary.\n",

    "The configuration described roughly represents the situation of high-level radioactive waste disposal in a salt dome. There, radioactive canisters with a diameter of 1 m are to be stored in 250 m deep boreholes at about 1 km depth. The average spacing of such boreholes is about 50 m across a width of 250 m and a length of 1–2 km. With a heat production of slightly less than 1 kW for a 1 m high canister, one arrives at approximately the above average heat production rate over the entire disposal area.\n",

    "### Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem numerically, we need to subdivide our model domain into a numerical grid. We assume that the temperature is defined at so-called *cell-centered* grid points (centroids) (see Fig. 2). To solve our problem, we also use so-called *ghost nodes* in our grid, which allow a correct incorporation of the boundary conditions.\n",

    "**Fig. 2.** Staggered grid. The temperature is defined at the cell-centered grid points, the centroids (red circles). The gray circles outside the model domain are the ghost nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given staggered grid enables a so-called *conservative* finite difference approximation, where it is assumed that the heat flux $q_{i,j} = -k \\frac{\\partial{T}}{\\partial{x_{i,j}}}$ is defined at the midpoint of the grid lines and the temperature is defined at the center of a grid cell (strictly speaking, the thermal conductivity is then also defined on the grid lines; however, since it is constant, we do not need to consider this here; for variable thermal parameters, the equation must be discretized somewhat differently). Moreover, using cell-centered temperature points in combination with *ghost nodes* allows us to incorporate boundary conditions relatively easily, while retaining the same order of accuracy as the central difference quotients in the interior of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When indexing our grid points, we distinguish between *local* and *global* indices. The local index describes the position on the $i$,$j$ grid. The global index is a running index from 1 to $nc_x \\cdot nc_y$ and corresponds to the number of equations, i.e., the total number of interior grid points. The global index is also used when assembling the coefficient matrix for our linear system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each grid point, i.e., for each equation, a so-called numerical stencil specifies the positions of the grid points that are relevant for the respective equation. The coefficients for these grid points are then non-zero, while all others are zero. The nomenclature for the stencil often follows that of a compass, i.e., we have points to the south, west, center, east, and north. For each equation, the global index ($I$) of each stencil point is given by its position relative to the central point ($I^\\textrm{C}$) of the stencil, i.e.:\n",

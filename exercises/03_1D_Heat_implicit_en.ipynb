Within the defect correction framework, the coefficient matrix for a 1D problem with constant thermal parameters can be assembled using the built-in function `AssembleMatrix1Dc!()`.\n",

    "In `GeoModBox.jl`, the residual $\\bm{r}$ is computed at the centroids, using the extended temperature field—including the ghost nodes of the current time step—as an initial guess:\n",

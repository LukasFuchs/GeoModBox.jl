    "Assume that Equation $(1)$ is defined in a 2D rectangular domain with a side length $\\left(L\\right)$ of 200 km and a depth $\\left(H\\right)$ of 100 km (Fig. 1). The temperature at the surface $\\left(T_{\\textrm{Surf}}\\right)$ is 0 °C and increases linearly within the domain with a thermal gradient. For the temperature boundary conditions on the sides, we assume *Neumann* conditions. At a depth of $z_a = H/2$, we assume a horizontally oriented anomaly with a thickness $\\left(h_a\\right)$ of 10 km, extending across the entire width of the domain (e.g., a sill). The anomaly has an initial temperature $\\left(T_a\\right)$ of 1600 °C and a volumetric heat production rate $\\left(Q_a\\right)$ of $4.7 \\cdot 10^{-6}$.\n",

    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem numerically, we need to subdivide our model domain into a numerical grid. We assume that the temperature and all other thermal properties are defined at the so-called *cell-centered* grid points (*centroids*) (see Fig. 2). This subdivision corresponds to that used for the [time-independent problem](./04_2D_Diffusion_Stationary_en.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve our problem, we again make use of the *ghost nodes* of our grid, which allow a correct incorporation of the boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grid and Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Figures/Exercise04_2.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"450\"/> <br>\n",
    "**Fig. 2.** Staggered grid. The temperature is defined at the cell-centered grid points, the centroids (red circles). The gray circles outside the model domain are the ghost nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given staggered grid enables a so-called *conservative* finite difference approximation, where it is assumed that the heat flux $q_{i,j} = -k \\frac{\\partial{T}}{\\partial{x_{i,j}}}$ is defined at the midpoint of the grid lines and the temperature is defined at the center of a grid cell (strictly speaking, the thermal conductivity is then also defined on the grid lines; however, since it is constant, we do not need to consider this here; for variable thermal parameters, the equation must be discretized somewhat differently; see the [documentation](https://geosci-ffm.github.io/GeoModBox.jl/dev/man/DiffTwoD)). Moreover, using cell-centered temperature grid points in combination with *ghost nodes* allows us to incorporate boundary conditions relatively easily, while retaining the same order of accuracy as the central difference quotients in the interior of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When indexing our grid points, we distinguish between *local* and *global* indices. The local index describes the position on the $i$,$j$ grid. The global index is a running index from 1 to $nc_x \\cdot nc_y$, where $nc_i$ is the number of centroids in the respective spatial direction, and corresponds to the number of equations, i.e., the total number of interior grid points. The global index is also used when assembling the coefficient matrix for our linear system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each central grid point, i.e., for each equation, a so-called numerical stencil specifies the positions of the grid points that are relevant for the respective equation. The coefficients for these grid points are then non-zero, while all others are zero. The nomenclature for the stencil often follows that of a compass, i.e., we have points to the south, west, center, east, and north (see Fig. 2). For each equation, the global index ($I$) of each stencil point is given by its relative position with respect to the central point ($I^\\textrm{C}$) of the stencil, i.e.:\n",

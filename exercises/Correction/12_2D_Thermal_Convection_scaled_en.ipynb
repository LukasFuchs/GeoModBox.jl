    "# Scaled Thermal Convection\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of numerical and analogue models is their scalability, i.e., their **non-dimensionalisation**. By introducing appropriate scaling constants, all physical units can be eliminated from the governing equations. Depending on the assumptions made, certain dimensionless parameters remain, which effectively characterize the physical behaviour.\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",

    "We again consider thermal convection, as in the [previous exercise](./11_2D_Thermal_Convection_en.ipynb).\n",

    "Under the same assumptions (e.g., the *Boussinesq* approximation), the governing equations for the two-dimensional case are:\n",

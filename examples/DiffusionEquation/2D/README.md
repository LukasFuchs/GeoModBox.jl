[Backward Euler](./BackwardEuler.jl)<br>
-> A gaussian diffusion using the defection correction method. The results are compared to the analytical solution.  

[Forward Euler](./ForwardEuler.jl)<br>
-> A gaussian diffusion using an explicit formulation. The results are compared to the analytical solution. 

[Gaussian Diffusion](./Gaussian_Diffusion.jl)<br>
-> Script to solve a 2D gaussian diffusion using multiple different finite difference schemes to solve a **linear** problem and resolutions. The results are compared to the analytical solution and the final plot shows a resolution test including each finite difference scheme.

[Gaussian Diffusion - General Solvert](./GeneralSolverTest.jl)<br>
-> Script to solve a 2D gaussian diffusion using the general combined solvers for a **non-linear** problem and and for different resolutions. The results are compared to the analytical solution and the final plot shows a resolution test including each finite difference scheme.

[Gaussian Diffusion - General Solvert](./GeneralSolverTest_variable_k.jl)<br>
-> Script to solve a 2D gaussian diffusion using the general combined solvers for a **non-linear** problem assuming variable thermal properties and for different resolutions. The results are compared to the analytical solution and the final plot shows a resolution test including each finite difference scheme.

[Resolution Test Poisson Problem](./Poisson_ResTest.jl)<br>
-> Resolution test for a 2-D Poisson Problem.

[Poisson Variable Parameters](./Poisson_variable_k.jl)<br>
-> 2-D Poisson Problem with variable thermal parameters.
